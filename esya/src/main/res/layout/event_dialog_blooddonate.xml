We the people at IIIT Delhi believe that we need to care for the society as a whole and give back in whatever way we can. We believe that students should take charge in that and lead forward. Taking this thinking forward we are going to organize a blood donation camp at IIITD in association with Blood Connect, a student run organization which conducts blood donation drives at various colleges."
